Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\\\\n\\\\nBottom line, this place sucks.

The menu says you can pay like an extra three or four dollars per cocktail to keep the glass, or you can choose not to. We said we didn't want the glasses, but when our bill came we realized they'd charged us for them anyway. Our waiter made up a lame story about the price that we knew was a fib because we read the menu (which he'd conveniently removed from the table). Finally, rather than arguing over a few dollars, we took the glasses and left. It was $120 plus tip for just my husband and me to eat there (and we are not large people).</td>\n",

The food is also quite good, unlike a lot of other coffee shops I've tried.  Try the quesadilla or the Aroma Salad.  Good music, too!  My only beef with them is that they close super-early in the evenings during semester break, meaning that those of us who actually LIVE here don't get to partake while the students are gone.  I would understand if Aroma were located closer to campus and got the vast majority of their business from college students, but every time I'm there, I see quite a few non-students, so I see no reason for them to close early.</td>\n",
